# Note: On Raspberry Pi, PyQt5 should be installed via system packages (python3-pyqt5)
# These are fallback requirements for other systems or when system packages aren't available

# For Raspberry Pi, use: sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtwebengine
# If WebEngine is not available, the app will fall back to WebKit or pip installation
# For other systems, pip will install these versions
