# Raspberry Pi specific requirements - Qt6 Version
# PyQt6 and related modules should be installed via system packages:
# sudo apt install python3-pyqt6 python3-pyqt6.qtwebengine python3-pyqt6.qtsvg

# For newer Raspberry Pi OS versions (Bookworm and later), Qt6 is available
# For older versions, you may need to build from source or use Qt5 version

# SVG support is essential for icons - install via:
# sudo apt install python3-pyqt6.qtsvg

# No additional Python packages needed for basic functionality
# This file exists for compatibility but should remain empty for Raspberry Pi
