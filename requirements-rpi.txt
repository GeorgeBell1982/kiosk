# Raspberry Pi specific requirements
# PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine should be installed via system packages:
# sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtwebengine

# No additional Python packages needed for basic functionality
# This file exists for compatibility but should remain empty for Raspberry Pi
